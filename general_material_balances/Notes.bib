@article{Luedeking:2000aa,
	Abstract = {Kinetic data are needed to develop basic understanding of fermentation processes and to permit rational design of continuous fermentation processes. The kinetics of the fermentation of glucose to lactic acid have been studied at six constant pH levels between 4. 5 and 6.0 by measuring the instantaneous rates of bacterial growth and of lactic acid formation throughout each fermentation. It was found that the instantaneous rate of acid formation dP/dt, should be related to the instantaneous rate of bacterial growth dN/dt, and to the bacterial density N, throughout a fermentation at a given pH, by the expression when the constants alpha and beta are determined by the pH of the fermentation.},

@article{Karr:2012ve,
	Abstract = {Understanding how complex phenotypes arise from individual molecules and their interactions is a primary challenge in biology that computational approaches are poised to tackle. We report a whole-cell computational model of the life cycle of the human pathogen Mycoplasma genitalium that includes all of its molecular components and their interactions. An integrative approach to modeling that combines diverse mathematics enabled the simultaneous inclusion of fundamentally different cellular processes and experimental measurements. Our whole-cell model accounts for all annotated gene functions and was validated against a broad range of data. The model provides insights into many previously unobserved cellular behaviors, including in vivo rates of protein-DNA association and an inverse relationship between the durations of DNA replication initiation and replication. In addition, experimental analysis directed by model predictions identified previously undetected kinetic parameters and biological functions. We conclude that comprehensive whole-cell models can be used to facilitate biological discovery.},
