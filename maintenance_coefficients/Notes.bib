@article{Luedeking:2000aa,
	Abstract = {Kinetic data are needed to develop basic understanding of fermentation processes and to permit rational design of continuous fermentation processes. The kinetics of the fermentation of glucose to lactic acid have been studied at six constant pH levels between 4. 5 and 6.0 by measuring the instantaneous rates of bacterial growth and of lactic acid formation throughout each fermentation. It was found that the instantaneous rate of acid formation dP/dt, should be related to the instantaneous rate of bacterial growth dN/dt, and to the bacterial density N, throughout a fermentation at a given pH, by the expression when the constants alpha and beta are determined by the pH of the fermentation.},

@article{BEKS14,
	Abstract = {The Julia programming language is gaining enormous popularity. Julia was designed to be easy and fast. Most importantly, Julia shatters deeply established notions widely held in the applied community:

1. High-level, dynamic code has to be slow by some sort of law of nature.
2. It is sensible to prototype in one language and then recode in another language.
3. There are parts of a system for the programmer, and other parts best left untouched as they are built by the experts.

Julia began with a deep understanding of the needs of the scientific programmer and the needs of the computer in mind. Bridging cultures that have often been distant, Julia combines expertise from computer science and computational science creating a new approach to scientific computing. This note introduces the programmer to the language and the underlying design theory. It invites the reader to rethink the fundamental foundations of numerical computing systems.

In particular, there is the fascinating dance between specialization and abstraction. Specialization allows for custom treatment. We can pick just the right algorithm for the right circumstance and this can happen at runtime based on argument types (code selection via multiple dispatch). Abstraction recognizes what remains the same after differences are stripped away and ignored as irrelevant. The recognition of abstraction allows for code reuse (generic programming). A simple idea that yields incredible power. The Julia design facilitates this interplay in many explicit and subtle ways for machine performance and, most importantly, human convenience.},
