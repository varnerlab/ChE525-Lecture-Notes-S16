@article{Edwards:2000yq,
	Abstract = {The Escherichia coli MG1655 genome has been completely sequenced. The annotated sequence, biochemical information, and other information were used to reconstruct the E. coli metabolic map. The stoichiometric coefficients for each metabolic enzyme in the E. coli metabolic map were assembled to construct a genome-specific stoichiometric matrix. The E. coli stoichiometric matrix was used to define the system's characteristics and the capabilities of E. coli metabolism. The effects of gene deletions in the central metabolic pathways on the ability of the in silico metabolic network to support growth were assessed, and the in silico predictions were compared with experimental observations. It was shown that based on stoichiometric and capacity constraints the in silico analysis was able to qualitatively predict the growth potential of mutant strains in 86% of the cases examined. Herein, it is demonstrated that the synthesis of in silico metabolic genotypes based on genomic, biochemical, and strain-specific information is possible, and that systems analysis methods are available to analyze and interpret the metabolic phenotype.},

@article{Luedeking:2000aa,
	Abstract = {Kinetic data are needed to develop basic understanding of fermentation processes and to permit rational design of continuous fermentation processes. The kinetics of the fermentation of glucose to lactic acid have been studied at six constant pH levels between 4. 5 and 6.0 by measuring the instantaneous rates of bacterial growth and of lactic acid formation throughout each fermentation. It was found that the instantaneous rate of acid formation dP/dt, should be related to the instantaneous rate of bacterial growth dN/dt, and to the bacterial density N, throughout a fermentation at a given pH, by the expression when the constants alpha and beta are determined by the pH of the fermentation.},

@article{Karr:2012ve,
	Abstract = {Understanding how complex phenotypes arise from individual molecules and their interactions is a primary challenge in biology that computational approaches are poised to tackle. We report a whole-cell computational model of the life cycle of the human pathogen Mycoplasma genitalium that includes all of its molecular components and their interactions. An integrative approach to modeling that combines diverse mathematics enabled the simultaneous inclusion of fundamentally different cellular processes and experimental measurements. Our whole-cell model accounts for all annotated gene functions and was validated against a broad range of data. The model provides insights into many previously unobserved cellular behaviors, including in vivo rates of protein-DNA association and an inverse relationship between the durations of DNA replication initiation and replication. In addition, experimental analysis directed by model predictions identified previously undetected kinetic parameters and biological functions. We conclude that comprehensive whole-cell models can be used to facilitate biological discovery.},
